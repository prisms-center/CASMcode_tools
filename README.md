#### casm-map

The casm-map package provides pure Python tools for structure mapping and import. This includes:

- A library and command line tool that enables:
  - searching for structure mappings
  - creating mapped structures
  - creating interpolated structures
  - generating structures with equivalent relative orientations
  - importing structures into CASM projects.

This package makes extensive use of lower-level methods which are implemented in [`libcasm-xtal`](https://github.com/prisms-center/CASMcode_crystallography), [`libcasm-mapping`](https://github.com/prisms-center/CASMcode_mapping), and [`libcasm-configuration`](https://github.com/prisms-center/CASMcode_configuration). 


#### Install

    pip install casm-map


#### Usage

See the [casm docs](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_pydocs/casm/overview/latest/).


#### About CASM
