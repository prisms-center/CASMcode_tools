casm-tools
==========

The casm-tools package provides CLI tools based on capabilities implemented in CASM.
This includes:

- casm.tools.calc: Setup, run, and report results of structure calculations
- casm.tools.convert: Convert structures and configurations between CASM and other
  formats
- casm.tools.map: Structure mapping and import


casm-map
--------

The casm-map command line program performs structure mapping and import, including:

- Searching for structure mappings
- Creating mapped structures
- Creating interpolated structures
- Generating structures with equivalent relative orientations
- Importing structures into CASM projects as CASM configurations with calculated
  properties.

This program makes extensive use of lower-level methods which are implemented in
`libcasm-xtal <https://github.com/prisms-center/CASMcode_crystallography>`_,
`libcasm-mapping <https://github.com/prisms-center/CASMcode_mapping>`_, and
`libcasm-configuration <https://github.com/prisms-center/CASMcode_configuration>`_.

Methods for searching for low-cost lattice, atom, and structure mappings, taking into
account symmetry are based on the approach described in :cite:t:`THOMAS2021a`.

A suggested way to cite this program is as follows:

    "Structure mappings were found with the `casm-map` program [1],
    using the method of Thomas et al. [2] implemented in CASM [3]."

About CASM
==========

The casm-tools package is part of the CASM_ open source software suite, which is
designed to perform first-principles statistical mechanical studies of multi-component
crystalline solids.

CASM is developed by the Van der Ven group, originally at the University of Michigan
and currently at the University of California Santa Barbara.
